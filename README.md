# chess-genetics

Genetic programming to find good positions for the following chess-variant:

* each player can freely choose the positions of his chess figures inside his half of the board
* each player cannot see the other half of the board during this phase
* once both players have set all figures the game starts in the normal way (white has the first move)
* castling (rochade) is not allowed in this chess variant
